Terraform - AWS - EC2 
# Prometheus, Grafana and Node-exporter using Docker images.
- In this post, I have deployed Logging tools on AWS using of EC2 instances.
In this instances, I have used ec2 instance which already has docker installed,
Another option is to create a new ubuntu instance and utilise this. Commented block code can be used for this purpose.
